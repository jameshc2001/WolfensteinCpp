# WolfensteinCpp

A small implementation of a basic version of the renderer used in games like Wolfenstein and Doom.  

This was done following a tutorial by Lode Vandevenne:  
https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html  

I used SDL2 for rendering the generated image each frame and recieving user input. All you can do is walk around a room and look 
left and right. There is some very rudimentary collision detection but the point of the program is to demonstrate the rendering technique.
